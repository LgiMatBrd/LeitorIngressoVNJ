Project Details
---------------

This sample is part of the [IntelÂ® XDK](http://xdk.intel.com). It scans a
barcode using the [Phonegap* Barcode Scanner plugin][1]. If you scan a UPC
(Universal Product Code) symbol you can lookup the product code in a UPC
database such as <http://www.upcdatabase.com>. The plugin reads a variety
of barcodes, such as QR_CODE, DATA_MATRIX and AZTEC.
